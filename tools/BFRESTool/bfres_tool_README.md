# BFRES-Tool v4.1
  
A tool for extracting/injecting textures to Wii U BFRES files.
  
Difference between "bfres_tool" and "bfres_tool_inject":
* "bfres_tool_inject" injects textures to the end of the file, which means you can inject a texture of any size and any format. The only drawback is that the BFRES file will get ridiculously bigger.
